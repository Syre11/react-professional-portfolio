          I am an aspiring software developer with an always expanding knowledge
          of full-stack development. When I'm not coding I have plenty of
          hobbies to fill my time. I love to play video games, mostly old school
          games and racing simulators. I play and watch lots of sports such as
          basketball, football and racing.

          I'm always interested in collaborating to build projects or solve
          problems. Navigate to the 'Contact Me' page to connect with me!
